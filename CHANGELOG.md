## Version History

### Versioning Strategy

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for version numbering:
- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
- **PATCH** version when making backwards compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. **Development** (`develop` branch)
   - Feature development and integration
   - Internal testing and code review

2. **Staging** (`staging` branch)
   - Pre-production testing
   - Performance and security validation
   - Integration testing with frontend

3. **Production** (`main` branch)
   - Stable releases only
   - Tagged releases with semantic versioning
   - Production deployment ready
